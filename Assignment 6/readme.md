# Assignment #6: Model Evaluation

## Pima India Diabetics Dataset

Using Pima Diabetics data create a pipeline to perform any feature processing and split the data into test and training sets. Create a logistic regression model pipeline that uses the above pipeline and using grid search cross-validation using 10 folds. Search 5 different regularization strengths and 2 solvers

# Data Definition
The datasets contain a number of medical predictor factors as well as one goal variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the patient's number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

**Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant

**Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

**BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

**SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

**Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

**BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

**DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function

**Age**: Age (years)

**Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1)

**Number of Observation Units** : 768 rows and 9 columns

# Business Question/Problem Statement

Using the Logistic Regression predicting the target variable class.

# EDA Observations
There is strong positve or negative correlation between any variables but BMI and Plasma Glucose and Age has correlation between the Class variable.

# Regression Results

# Supervised Machine learning to predict COVID-19 Lab result
Project By

Sharath Srinivas (AD59693)

## Introduction 
In this project supervised machine learning techniques are used to develop predictive models for the COVID-19 infection, using an epidemiology labeled dataset for positive and negative COVID-19 cases in Mexico, with supervised learning algorithms such as decision tree, logistic regression,Random Forest and naive Bayes, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors
## Problem Statement 
The global pandemic 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 is caused by the latest pandemic outbreak of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first discovered in bats in late December 2019 in the Chinese province of Wuhan, with evidence suggesting it spread to people via intermediary hosts such as raccoons, dogs etc. Significant COVID-19 symptoms include fever (98%) cough (76%) and diarrhea (3%), which are generally more severe in older persons with chronic conditions , and many patients have reported shortness of breath, which in many cases appears to be a sign of the flu. , 2019 Since its discovery in late 2019, Covid has spread rapidly throughout the world.

## Motivation 
The healthcare and economic sectors are both at risk becasue of COVID-19. It's evident that non-clinical tools like machine learning, data mining, expert systems, and other artificial intelligence techniques will be crucial in diagnosing and containing the COVID-19 epidemic. The motivation of this project to contribute my domain and technical knowledge to fight against the disease

## Objectives 
To predict covid 19 results based on the symptoms of the patient.
In this project we will be using the Lab result of covid antigen test as our target variables.
## Dataset
The data set used was provided by Mexico's Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases and includes information on all COVID19-related cases, including positive and negative tested individuals. 
This data set is available for download using below link.
